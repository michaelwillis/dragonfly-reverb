    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Dragonfly Room Reverb is a free stereo-to-stereo reverb effect.
      It has several different room presets, as well as a small number
      of hall presets and effect presets. It is based on ProG Reverb
      from Freeverb3VST, which uses Moorer's early reflection model
      and an implementation of Jon Dattorro's Progenitor Reverb
      algorithm.

      The output of the Dry, Early, and Late controls are combined to
      form the reverb’s output signal. Note that sliders are not
      controlled by the presets. This allows you to set the levels in
      a way that works for your project, and then explore different
      presets without the sliders changing.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic Dials</h2>
    <p>
      Note that holding the Shift key and clicking a dial will reset
      the dial to the default for the current preset.
    </p>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-room-reverb/size-width-dials.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>Size</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Length of the reverb’s internal delay lines. Increasing the
          Size parameter generally leads to a smoother, less resonant
          output however it can also increase the reverb’s attack time
          and make individual early reflections more audible.
          Decreasing the Size parameter generally has the opposite
          effect, decreasing the reverb’s attack time and making
          individual early reflections less audible although it can
          increase the presence of metallic resonances.
        </p>
        <p>
          In physical terms, the Size control corresponds to the
          largest dimension of an imaginary space. When the size is
          small, the “walls” of this space are closer together and the
          resultant reflection density increases. When the size is
          large, that reflection density decreases.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Width</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The Width control sets the output stereo width. Note that
          this applies to both the early reflections and the late
          reverberation.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-room-reverb/predelay-decay-dials.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>Predelay</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Delay before the onset of the late reverberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that only the late reverberation is delayed. Early
          reflections are always output immediately. You can see this
          by doing the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Set Early Level to 100% and Late Level to 0%.</li>
            <li>Observe on the spectrogram that changing the Predelay does not move the early reflections.</li>
            <li>Set Early Level to 0% and Late Level to 100%.</li>            
            <li>Observe on the spectrogram that changing the Predelay moves the late reverberation.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Decay</dt>
      <dd>
        Length of time for the late reverberation to decrease by 60dB.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Preset Browser</h2>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-room-reverb/presets.png" />
    <p>
      The Preset Browser section presents the user with a range of
      room, hall, and effect presets.
    </p>
    <h2>Spectrogram</h2>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-room-reverb/spectrogram.png" />
    <p>
      The spectrogram has been included so that the user can get a
      better idea of how the various reverb parameters affect the
      plug-in’s output. The spectrogram is rendered by simulating a
      burst of white noise through the reverb algorithm with the
      current settings, and then processing the output with a fast
      fourier transform algorithm.
    </p>

      Clicking on the “?” displays the plugin name, version, license,
      and credits.

    <h2>Advanced Dials</h2>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-room-reverb/modulation-dials.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>Diffuse</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Adjusts the coefficients of the allpass filters in the late
          reverberation algorithm. It enables the user to balance echo
          density against unpleasant colouration so that the result
          enhances rather than detracts from the audio input signal.
        </p>
        <p>
          A challenge that the designers of early digital reverbs
          faced was generating a realistic number of early reflections
          or echo density. One solution to this problem was to use
          allpass filter networks. Although successful in increasing
          echo density, the downside of allpass filter networks is
          that they have a tendency to resonate, particularly when the
          input signal is impulsive. This means that there is a
          tradeoff between echo density and colouration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, low echo density or diffusion settings increase
          the perception of discrete echoes. In the case of
          transient-rich sounds this can lead to “machine-gun-like”
          effects in which individual echoes are heard. For sustained
          sounds, this is less of an issue. Increasing the Diffusion
          setting makes individual echoes less perceptible and
          generally leads to a smoother, more lush reverb sound
          however it also can introduce metallic resonances which can
          be noticeable but depend to a large extent on the nature of
          the input signal.
        </p>
        <p>
          To better understand the effects of the Diffuse control,
          open a track with clear percussive sounds. Decreasing the
          Diffuse value will result in fewer, more discrete
          reflections in the late reverberation. When set at very low
          values the late reverberation has an almost "shattering"
          sound to it. A higher Diffuse setting results in the late
          reverberation having a smoother and richer sound.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Spin</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Rate of modulated chorus effect on the late
          reverberation. Higher Spin values can lead to an audible
          “wobble” particularly in real instruments such as acoustic
          guitar or piano and can also cause noise on pure tones. This
          effect tends to be less noticeable on speech.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Wander</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Length of modulated chorus effect on the late reverberation,
          measured in milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          To better understand the effects of Spin and Wander, set a
          large room size, a long delay, Modulation to 100%, and
          Wander to 0%. Then play an abrupt sound such as a
          percussion hit or a chord on piano or guitar. You'll notice
          the reverb tail panning alternately left and right in the
          stereo field at the rate set by Spin control. There are
          multiple layers to the late reverberation, but they are all
          synchronised in the stereo space when Wander is set to 0
          ms. Next, increase the Wander setting, which will make the
          layers spread out in the stereo space. The layers all still
          spin at the same rate, but at any given time each one has
          its own location in the stereo field.
